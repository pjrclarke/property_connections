            <p>Our use of your personal data will always have a lawful basis, either because it is necessary for Our performance of a contract with you, because you have consented to Our use of your personal data (e.g. by subscribing to emails), or because it is in Our legitimate interests. Specifically, We may use your data for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Providing and managing your Account</li>

            <p>With your permission and/or where permitted by law, We may also use your data for marketing purposes which may include contacting you by email, telephone, text message or post with information, news and offers on Our products and/or services. We will not, however, send you any unsolicited marketing or spam and will take all reasonable steps to ensure that We fully protect your rights and comply with Our obligations under the GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003.</p>
            <br>
        <h2>7. Storing your data</h2>
            <p>We do not keep your personal data for any longer than is necessary in light of the reason(s) for which it was first collected. Some or all of your data may be stored outside of the UK or European Economic Area (“the EEA”) (The EEA consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein). You are deemed to accept and agree to this by using Our Site and submitting information to Us. If We do store data outside the EEA, We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the GDPR.</p>
            <br>
        <h2>8. Do We Share Your Data?</h2>
            <p>In certain circumstances, We may be legally required to share certain data held by Us, which may include your personal data, for example, where We are involved in legal proceedings, where We are complying with legal obligations, a court order, or a governmental authority.</p>
            <p>We may sometimes contract with third parties to supply products and services to you on Our behalf. These may include payment processing, delivery of goods, search engine facilities, advertising, and marketing. In some cases, the third parties may require access to some or all of your data. Where any of your data is required for such a purpose, We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data will be handled safely, securely, and in accordance with your rights, Our obligations, and the obligations of the third party under the law.</p>
            <p>We may compile statistics about the use of Our Site including data on traffic, usage patterns, user numbers, sales, and other information. All such data will be anonymised and will not include any personally identifying data, or any anonymised data that can be combined with other data and used to identify you.</p>
            <p>We may sometimes use third party data processors that are located outside of the UK or European Economic Area (“the EEA”) (The EEA consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein). Where We transfer any personal data outside the EEA, We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the GDPR.</p>
            <br>
        <h2>9. What Happens If Our Business Changes Hands?</h2>
            <p>We may, from time to time, expand or reduce Our business and this may involve the sale and/or the transfer of control of all or part of Our business. Any personal data that you have provided will, where it is relevant to any part of Our business that is being transferred, be transferred along with that part and the new owner or newly controlling party will, under the terms of this Privacy Policy, be permitted to use that data only for the same purposes for which it was originally collected by Us.</p>
            <br>
        <h2>10. How Can You Control Your Data?</h2>    
            <p>When you submit personal data via Our Site, you may be given options to restrict Our use of your data. In particular, We aim to give you strong controls on Our use of your data for direct marketing purposes (including the ability to opt-out of receiving emails from Us).</p>
            <p>You may also wish to sign up to one or more of the preference services operating in the UK: The Telephone Preference Service (“the TPS”), the Corporate Telephone Preference Service (“the CTPS”), and the Mailing Preference Service (“the MPS”). These may help to prevent you receiving unsolicited marketing. Please note, however, that these services will not prevent you from receiving marketing communications that you have consented to receiving.</p>
            <br>
        <h2>11. How Can You Access Your Data?</h2>    
            <p>You have the right to ask for a copy of any of your personal data held by Us (where such data is held). Under the GDPR, no fee is payable and We will provide any and all information in response to your request free of charge.

            <ul>
                <li>Certain features of Our Site depend on Cookies to function. Cookie Law deems these Cookies to be “strictly necessary”. These Cookies are described below.

                <br>
                <li>By using Our Site you may also receive certain third party Cookies on your computer or device. Third party Cookies are those placed by websites, services, and/or parties other than Us. These Cookies are not integral to the functioning of Our Site and your use and experience of Our Site will not be impaired by refusing consent to them.</li>

        <h2>14. Types of Cookies</h2>
            <p>There are several types of Cookies, some of which may be used by and on Our Site.</p>
            <h5>Strictly Necessary Cookies</h5>    
            <p>These cookies are essential for the running of a website and its features. They allow proper website functionality and access to services such as your account, secure shopping and posting comments on a blog. Without them, a website cannot perform properly.</p>
            <h5>Performance Cookies</h5>    
            <p>These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website. For example, which pages are visited most often, how people navigate around the site and if there are any error messages that appear. They don’t collect any information that identifies a user, only anonymised, aggregated information that is used to improve the way the website works and the customer journey.</p>
            <h5>Functionality Cookies</h5>    
            <p>These cookies allow a website to remember your preferences and choices you make, such as your preferred language, region and username. They gather information on things you customise and select and retain it for your next visit. They are not essential but enhance the user experience of a site.</p>
            <h5>Third Party Cookies</h5>    
            <p>Some website pages may use third party services or software, such as maps, online videos or social networking features. Many of these services may set cookies in your browser. This website has no control over third party cookies but visitors can opt out of these cookies via their browser.</p>
            <h5>Flash cookies</h5>    
            <p>Flash cookies are commonly used in website advertisements, video clips and animation. They enable a website to recognise the user’s browser when it returns and store information such as when a video stopped playing. They also provide functions such as remembering your settings and preferences.</p>
            <h5>Advertising Cookies</h5>    
            <p>These cookies are used by advertisers to deliver adverts that are more relevant to you and your interests. They keep track of which ads a person has viewed, control how many times they are exposed to the same advert and track the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. This information can then be used in remarketing, by customising adverts the user sees on other websites.</p>
            <h5>Web Beacons</h5>    
            <p>Web beacons are bits of data that count the number of users who access a website or webpage. They allow an organisation to see if a cookie has been activated, if a user has clicked through to links to adverts contained in emails. This is used to identify which emails are of most interest to a customer and to track the success of advertisements.</p>
            <br>
        <h2>15. Enabling/Disabling Cookies</h2>
            <p>In addition to the controls that We provide, you can choose to enable or disable Cookies in your internet browser. Most internet browsers also enable you to choose whether you wish to disable all cookies or only third party Cookies. By default, most internet browsers accept Cookies but this can be changed. For further details, please consult the help menu in your internet browser or the documentation that came with your device.</p>
            <p>You can choose to delete Cookies on your computer or device at any time, however you may lose any information that enables you to access Our Site more quickly and efficiently including, but not limited to, login and personalisation settings.</p>
